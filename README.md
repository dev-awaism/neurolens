## Overview

**NeuroLens** is an enterprise-grade, cloud-ready, full-stack platform engineered for the advanced analysis, monitoring, and management of brain health. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning, distributed microservices, and secure, scalable infrastructure, NeuroLens empowers clinicians, researchers, and healthcare providers with actionable cognitive intelligence at scale.

The platform integrates multi-modal data ingestion, real-time AI inference, and advanced analytics, all orchestrated via a robust, event-driven backend and a modern, extensible frontend. NeuroLens is designed for extensibility, interoperability, and compliance with global healthcare standards.

## System Architecture

NeuroLens employs a modular, cloud-native, and horizontally scalable architecture:

- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React, featuring dynamic routing, real-time data visualization, and advanced state management via Redux and Context API. Supports SSR and offline-first capabilities.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express REST API, architected as stateless microservices, with support for GraphQL, WebSockets, and event-driven communication via message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).
- **Model Integration**: Python/Flask microservice for AI/ML model serving, supporting TensorFlow Serving, ONNX, and multi-model orchestration. Includes GPU acceleration and batch inference.
- **Database Layer**: Polyglot persistence with MongoDB (NoSQL), PostgreSQL (relational), and support for time-series and graph databases for advanced analytics.
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Containerized with Docker, orchestrated via Kubernetes (K8s), with Helm charts for deployment. Integrated with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform).
- **Observability**: Centralized logging (ELK/EFK stack), distributed tracing (Jaeger), and real-time monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture, OAuth2/OpenID Connect, RBAC/ABAC, end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3), and audit logging.
- **Interoperability**: HL7/FHIR integration, REST/gRPC APIs, and support for DICOM medical imaging standards.
